# Topic: The Perfect Summer

## Introduction

School is finally out! No more assignments, projects nor lectures. I made a promise to myself that this is going to be the best summer. The next day, my friend James called to find out what adventure I am going on this summer. I told him I have the summer all planned out. What do you do next?
