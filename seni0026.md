# The Barbeque

Later that day I contacted all my friends and told them about the barbeque I am planning. Everyone was excited and promised to bring something. When Saturday came, at 21<sup>o</sup>C, the sun was shining and the atmosphere was just right for a cookout. We set up by the pool in our friend Jame's backyard, and started the grill. Moments after, the smell of food filled the air. With the music playing, everyone's eating, dancing, chatting and enjoying themselves, in that moment, I knew this was only the beginning of the perfect summer.
