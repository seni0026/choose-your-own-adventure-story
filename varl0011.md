## Hiking into Summer

As part of the plans I had made, the following weekend I went hiking with my friend and a small group of others. We picked a trail just outside the city that promised beautiful views at the top. The path led us through tall pine trees, where sunlight danced through the branches and the air smelled fresh and earthy. At times the climb was steep and tiring, but we kept motivating each other with laughter, stories, and short breaks to catch our breath. Along the way, we spotted a few deer grazing in the distance and even came across a small stream where we cooled our hands. After a long trek, we finally reached the summit, and the sight was breathtaking - the valley stretched out endlessly, with a river sparkling far below. We sat on the rocks, shared snacks, and simply enjoyed the peaceful moment. As the sun began to dip lower, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, I felt grateful for the day. With the breeze on my face and the sound of my friendâ€™s laughter beside me, I realized that adventures like this were what truly made summer feel perfect.
