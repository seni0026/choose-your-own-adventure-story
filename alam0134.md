## Kayaking into Summer

It was one of those perfect summer mornings clear skies, warm breeze, and the lake sparkling under the sun. My friends and I carried our kayaks down to the water, laughing as we tried not to trip over each other’s paddles.

As soon as we pushed off, the quiet of the lake was broken by our voices echoing across the water. We raced each other to the far side, paddles splashing, sending cool sprays into the air. At times, we slowed down, drifting side by side, talking about everything and nothing while the waves gently rocked our kayaks.

Halfway through, we discovered a small cove hidden behind tall reeds. We stopped there, tied our kayaks together, and just floated. Someone pulled out snacks, and we shared them while dipping our feet into the water, the sun warming our faces.

By the time we paddled back to shore, our arms were sore, but our hearts were light. The laughter, the little races, and the quiet moments made it more than just kayaking—it was a memory we knew we’d talk about every summer after.
