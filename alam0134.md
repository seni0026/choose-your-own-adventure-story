## Summer on the Lake

It was the first week of summer break, and the sun was shining bright. A group of friends decided to spend the afternoon kayaking at the lake.

They carried their paddles and life jackets, laughing as they raced to see who could push their kayak into the water first. The lake sparkled under the sunlight, and the air felt warm and fresh.

Out on the water, they splashed each other, tried to race, and even stopped in the middle to just float and watch the clouds drift by. Some of them were good at steering, while others kept spinning in circles and laughing at themselves.

After a while, they paddled to a small sandy spot and took a break, dipping their feet into the cool water. The sound of birds and the gentle waves made it feel peaceful.

By the end of the day, they were tired but happy. With wet clothes, sun-kissed skin, and big smiles, they promised to come back again before summer ended.
