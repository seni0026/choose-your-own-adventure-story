# Lemonade + Cookies

The smell of freshly baked cookies drifts into the air, mixing perfectly with the zesty aroma of lemonade.  
A small group of kids notices and rushes over, their parents following close behind.  
The first batch of cookies disappears almost instantly, and you and James share a quick smile.  
More people arrive, curious about the stand with the bright sign and cheerful vibes.  
A jogger slows down, grabs a cup of lemonade, and tells you it’s “the best refreshment in town.”  
The word spreads, and soon a little line forms near your stand.  
James whispers, “We might actually have a real business here.”  
The excitement grows, but so does the pressure—you only have one small table.  
Your supplies are scattered, and it’s getting harder to serve everyone smoothly.  
You start thinking about what to do next to keep things organized.  
Should you borrow equipment or invest in something bigger?
